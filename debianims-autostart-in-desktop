Autostart programs via terminal
The Mate autostart GUI tool is a great way to manage automatic startup programs quickly. However, it’s not the only way. If you’re a terminal fan, you can also create automatic startup entries in the command-line.

To make a new startup entry, launch a terminal window with Ctrl + Alt + T or Ctrl + Shift + T. Then, move the terminal session into the /usr/share/applications/ directory.

cd /usr/share/applications/
Run the ls command and view the program shortcuts in the folder, so that you may locate the name of the program you want to auto-start.

ls
Can’t find the app you need? Combine ls with the grep tool to more easily filter out a keyword.

ls | grep programname
Take the name of the program and plug it into the following cp command to create a new autostart entry. For example, to autostart Firefox on Mate through the terminal, you’d do:

cp firefox.desktop ~/.config/autostart/
Removing automatic program start in the terminal
To get rid of an automatic startup entry for the Mate desktop environment from the command-line, you’ll need CD into the ~/.config/autostart directory.

cd ~/.config/autostart
Can’t access the ~/.config/autostart directory on your Mate desktop? If so, you may not have an autostart folder. To create one, use the mkdir command.

mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart
Inside of the autostart folder, run the ls command. Running this command will allow you to take a look inside the folder.

ls

Take note of the files revealed by the ls tool. Then, plug them into the following rm command to delete and disable the startup entries.

rm programname.desktop
Want to delete more than one startup entry at a time? Use the rm command, but instead of specifying the exact name of the startup entry file (such as firefox.desktop,) you can make use of the wildcard (*) function in Bash on Linux.

Using the wildcard (*) will allow you to automatically remove and delete all desktop shortcut files from the ~/.config/autostart directory.

rm *.desktop
