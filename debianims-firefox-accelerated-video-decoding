For Ubuntu for now:

First check that vaapi has hardware video decoding support:

sudo -s
apt install -y ffmpeg mesa-va-drivers vainfo
exit
vainfo

If yes continue down here:

1) Need to use Gnome in Wayland

https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-enable-disable-wayland-on-ubuntu-20-04-desktop

sudo -s
apt install -y gnome-session-wayland gdm3 gnome-core wayland-protocols htop synaptic mesa-va-drivers vainfo

=====================
Select GDM3 when asked during install.
=====================

WaylandEnable is set false by Ubuntu at compile time so need
nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf

=====================
WaylandEnable=true
=====================

sync
poweroff
Power on the PC
After selecting the user and not putting password a small gear (*) will appear down right.
Press it.
Select Gnome on Wayland
Activities -> Terminal
As user:
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
htop

2) If missing VP9 hardware deconding on the GPU need to install h264ify in Firefox:

https://addons.mozilla.org/ro/firefox/addon/h264ify/

3) Need to configure Firefox:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox#Hardware_video_acceleration
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox/Tweaks#Enable_OpenGL_Off-Main-Thread_Compositing_(OMTC)

Since Firefox 75, H.264 hardware acceleration via VA-API is supported, other formats are supported since Firefox 76. [1]

Hardware acceleration only works when using Wayland; Xorg support is not implemented yet. [2]

Before trying VA-API support in Firefox be sure to:

Install correct VA-API driver for your video card and verify VA-API has been enabled and working correctly, see Hardware video acceleration;
Set widget.wayland-dmabuf-vaapi.enabled to true in about:config;
Enable appropriate hardware accelerated compositing for Firefox (GL compositor or WebRender): 

=====================
OpenGL works ok:
=====================

Basic software OMTC is enabled by default.

To check if OpenGL OMTC is enabled, go to about:support and under the "Graphics" section look for "Compositing". If it reports "Basic", OpenGL OMTC is disabled; if it reports "OpenGL" it is enabled.

If OpenGL OMTC is disabled, you can force-enable it by going to about:config and enabling layers.acceleration.force-enabled. Restart Firefox for changes to take effect. 
    
Set media.ffvpx.enabled to false in about:config to disable the bundled FFmpeg;
    
Test:
    
Open htop in Terminal
    
Open Firefox
    
Go to Youtube, play some videos, select 1080p HD quality
    
If after 20 seconds minute playback of each video CPU usage is below 40% for a dual core CPU
    
like a Pentium D or AMD Athlon X2 then video accelerated decoding works ok.

X11 having ffmpeg disabled in Firefox is under 70%

X11 having ffmpeg enabled in Firefox is under 90%

Step 5 will make Firefox avoid X11 in Ubuntu

4) If default Desktop environment is not Gnome on Wayland at startup use:

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/367294/how-do-i-change-my-default-session

sudo -s
update-alternatives --config x-session-manager

=====================
Number for Gnome on Wayland then Enter
=====================

poweroff
Power on the PC.

5) Make Firefox avoid X11 in Ubuntu

https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/the-state-of-wayland-vs-x-esp-in-regard-to-to-the-next-lts/12576/10

The Firefox Wayland support feels super snappy now. If you want to try that out, I recommend the following commands to set the Wayland env variable globally for your user (only recommended for GNOME- and Ubuntu-session users):

mkdir -p ~/.config/environment.d
touch ~/.config/environment.d/60_firefox.conf
echo MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 >>~/.config/environment.d/60_firefox.conf

LOG out and back in again to have an effect!!!

If you don’t set the the variable globally and just create a local .desktop file then links from e.g. Thunderbird or Polari won’t open because it tries to open an XWayland-Firefox instance in addtion to the Wayland one, which results in an error message.

If you want to disable the Wayland mode again, you have to delete the 60_firefox.conf file:

    rm ~/.config/environment.d/60_firefox.conf

The adventurous can opt-in to using the GPU driven Webrender engine in addition to the Wayland support which has to be done from within Firefox itself --> in about:config set gfx. webrender. all to True to enable it or to False to disable it.

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Firefox#Wayland

You may enter about:support in the URL bar to check the Window Protocol. It should say wayland instead of x11.

To test Firefox vaapi acceleration in Ubuntu 20.04:
1) sudo apt install -y ffmpeg mesa-va-drivers vainfo wayland-protocols
2) For GPU without support for VP9 install in Firefox:
https://addons.mozilla.org/ro/firefox/addon/h264ify/
3) Make Firefox try to start in wayland instead of X11 as user:
mkdir -p ~/.config/environment.d
touch ~/.config/environment.d/60_firefox.conf
echo MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 >>~/.config/environment.d/60_firefox.conf
4) Configure in Firefox about:config :
widget.wayland-dmabuf-vaapi.enabled = true
layers.acceleration.force-enabled = true
media.ffvpx.enabled = false
5) Power off the PC.
6) At Ubuntu login screen choose down right Ubuntu on Wayland before entering the user password.
7) Verify Ubuntu is on Wayland: echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE = wayland not x11
8) Verify Firefox is on Wayland: about:support CTRL+F Window Protocol = wayland not x11
9) Playing youtube video in 1080p HD the CPU usage for an AMD Athlon X2 = 20% on wayland, 90% on x11
